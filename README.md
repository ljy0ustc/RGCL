Sihang Li, Xiang Wang*, An Zhang, Ying-Xin Wu, Xiangnan He and Tat-Seng Chua

In ICML 2022.

## Experiments

* Transfer Learning

* Unsupervised TU datasets

* Semi-supervised MNIST



## Potential Issues

Some issues might occur due to the version mismatch.

* ```KeyError:'num_nodes'``` in unsupervised TU datasets: [#36](https://github.com/Shen-Lab/GraphCL/issues/36), [#41](https://github.com/Shen-Lab/GraphCL/issues/41)
* ```AttributeError: 'Data' object has no attribute 'cat_dim'``` in Transfer Learning: [#13](https://github.com/Shen-Lab/GraphCL/issues/13)
